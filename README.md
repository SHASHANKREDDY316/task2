 What I Did
Loaded and Inspected the Dataset

Checked data structure, column types, and initial rows.

Handled Missing Values

Filled missing Age and Fare with mean values.

Filled missing Embarked with mode.

Generated Summary Statistics

Used .describe() to analyze numerical features.

Created Visualizations

Histograms: Age, Fare

Boxplots: Age vs Survived, Fare vs Pclass

Countplots: Survival count by Sex and Pclass

Correlation Heatmap

Derived Basic Insights

Younger passengers had better survival rates.

Females survived at a higher rate than males.

1st class passengers were more likely to survive.

Higher fare correlated with higher passenger class.
